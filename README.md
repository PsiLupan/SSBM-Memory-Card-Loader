# SSBM Memory Card Loader

My work on using wParam's Nametag Buffer Overflow Exploit in Super Smash Bros. Melee in order to load useful codes onto a
a memory card.

Unlike Dan Salvato's Tournament Edition, this exploit uses pure PPC ASM, instead of injecting the Gecko Loader. This may make it
less readable for users, but this code is ultimately for the learning experience.
